# MCAPS Tech Connect 2025 - Build M365 Declarative Agents & API Actions with Copilot Studio Lab

In this lab, you're going to create a low code no code declarative agent using Microsoft Copilot Studio. Thanks to the capabilities of the Microsoft Copilot Studio and the inbuilt connectors, you'll be able to create an agent powered by Generative AI that can be published and consumed across multiple channels, like Microsoft Teams, Microsoft 365 Copilot.
You will learn how to:

1. Create a basic agent using Microsoft Copilot Studio
2. Ground the agent responses in internal data retrieved through a Power Platform Connector
3. Control the behavior of your Agent
4. Publish the agent to M365 Copilot
